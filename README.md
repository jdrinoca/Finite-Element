### Why?
Good question.

I was taking a course in the [finite element method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) right around the same time that I had finally gotten Python working on my desktop, so I decided to combine the two and test my ability to ~~google~~ program.  The script was only intended to be text-based and contained to a single Python file, but I was playing around with the Matplotlib animation function and the project grew from there.
