### Why?
Good question.

I was taking a course in the [finite element method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) right around the same time that I had finally gotten python working on my desktop.  I had originally inteded to create a text-based solver to help with some homework problems, but I was playing around with matplotlib, and the project crew from there.
